        <div class="col-lg-7">
                    <p>Wayfarer is a mobile application that will provide extensive information on State and National Park details and amenities for users to tailor their next park visit based on their interests and needs. It will allow users to compare park amenities such as campsites, hiking trails, and photography locations based on quality attributes like shaded areas, seclusion from other visitors, and difficulty of the activity. Additionally, users will be able to pay for park admissions, campsite reservations, and any other rentals through the system.</p>

                <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                    <p>State and National Park systems provide too much general information with little value to individual park visitors. The Wayfarer system will allow users to streamline their park visit planning by providing comparable information that is specific to their interests. It will also make the reservation process easier.</p>
<br>
                <h3>Target Audience</h3>
                    <p>This project targets users who are looking for a way to plan outdoor activities at national and state parks. It aims to simplify the process of planning multi-day outdoor trips with detailed itineraries, as well as single-day trips for users interested in one specific feature of the park such as running/bike trails, lakes, canoe rentals, guided hikes, etc.</p>
                        
                    <p>Additionally, this project aims to provide information for those who are having trouble finding outdoor activities in their area or within the desired location. This project serves as a one-stop resource for all outdoor enthusiasts ranging from amateur to experienced to enjoy the outdoors.</p>

                <h3>User Research</h3>
                    <p>In our first round of research, we conducted one-on-one interviews with eight participants ranging in age from 25 to 64 and in camping/hiking experience from beginner to expert. The goal was designing a better way for discovering National Parks, camping and activities to do within the parks, and historical information regarding the parks’ landmarks. We asked participants a range of questions regarding their detailed personal experiences at outdoor parks, how they planned these adventures, and negative/positive takeaways from these trips.</p>
<br>
<!--              <h5>Interview Insights</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Safety concerns were mentioned by most users. Due to pandemic restrictions, there are social distancing and health risk concerns. As well as long-standing safety concerns over visibility at night, camping solo, dangerous wildlife, etc.</li>
                        <li>Resources are important to most subjects. Due to cellular connection and batteries draining the users feel more comfortable navigating with a physical map because they are less likely to be without it. The subjects did use online resources to help locate nearby hikes and see images of the park as well.</li>
                        <li>Subjects who like to do day trips prefer nearby parks, whereas subjects who like to go on multi-day tips do not care about how far the park is.</li>
                        <li>Users who stated camping was their preferred activity, placed high importance on campground layout.</li>
                        <li>Across all users, most people interviewed gave preference to the planning of activities within the parks as the most important feature.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h5>User Personas</h5>
                    <p>The below user personas were created based off of results from our one-on-one interviews where participants fell into one of two groups: those who value planning their trips before going and those who value reviewing a trip afterwards to provide insight for fellow park-goers.</p>
                    <p><img src="img/wayfarer_persona1.png" alt="Elijah persona" width=100%></p>
                    <h6><u>Focus Scenario</u>: Hiker Returns Home [After]</h6>
                        <p>Elijah is a full-time student who goes camping with his 3 roommates to relieve some stress from his current semester. We chose this scenario because Elijah is looking to disconnect from technology to relieve stress during his hike. Our system is not as relevant during the experience and is more useful to him after his trip. User-provided reviews about parks, trails, and campsites will give information to future visitors to plan their hike. Below are tasks that could be carried out in this scenario:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Add pictures from hike to share with other app users</li>
                                <li>Write a review of the guided hike</li>
                                <li>Favorite landmarks that were missed during this trip for future visits</li>
                                <li>Look to see other camping or hiking places nearby</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
<br>
                    <p><img src="img/wayfarer_persona2.png" alt="Alba persona" width=100%></p>
                    <h6><u>Focus Scenario</u>: Camper Plans Park Trip [Before]</h6>
                        <p>Alba is a professional and a mother of a 5- and 10-year-old who wants to take their family on their first camping trip. We chose this as one of our focus scenarios because the planning process is the most important part of Alba’s experience. Because she is a busy professional and mother of two she needs to research everything she needs to know for their trip beforehand. Once Alba and her family arrive, they do not have to waste time on finding activities to do or scrambling to find an ideal campsite. Below are tasks that could be carried out in this scenario:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Search for camping and swimming activities near me</li>
                                <li>Filter activities by kid-friendliness and peak times to visit</li>
                                <li>View descriptions of parks</li>
                                <li>Favorite landmarks, activities, and campsites at park</li>
                                <li>Compare and contrast reviews of favorites to reach a decision on your reservations</li>
                                <li>Book reservations for activities and campsite(s) on your calendar</li>
                                <li>Enable notifications for calendar events/general park notifications</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>The below journey map outlines the stages Alba must complete in order to plan her camping trip. The journey was created for her scenario because it is the more challenging of the two personas, requiring more preparation and steps to complete.</p>

            <h5>Interface Metaphors</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><u>Search</u>: <em>Catalog with index table.</em> You can look up multiple activities happening within the park. Also you can compare and contrast campsites.</li>
                    <li><u>Reservations</u>: <em>Shopping cart.</em> You add what you want to purchase inside a shopping cart. You can also change your mind and take things out when you find something better.</li>
                    <li><u>Payments</u>: <em>Cash register for payments.</em> Cash registers in the real world allow store clerks to sum up the cost of all of the items and calculate tax that the customer owes if they wish to purchase them. Additionally, it accepts payment and produces a proof of purchase. A cash register metaphor works for the purchase process of items in a user’s shopping cart. These items include campsite reservations, park admission, and other activity fees. All items are purchased with a single collective transaction.</li>
                    <li><u>Map</u>: <em>Paper map for wayfinding.</em> Paper maps use labels for streets and landmarks to help readers navigate their way around. Additionally, paper maps use iconography to concisely mark common landmarks on the map. In our system, it is important to allow users to discover new parks, hiking trails, campsites, and other outdoor landmarks in a map context. Users can determine the best way to get to a point of interest through a map visual.</li>

            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>We used an open card sort for surveying users, but they may have benefited more from a closed card sort as there was a large variety in the categories they chose to group together.</li>

                    <li>When we originally demoed our prototype in class, users of the app were confused by the static filters that were pre-selected for activities. We changed this so that users can pick and choose activities they would like to see.</li>

                    <li>We also decided to make our main navigation menu at the bottom of the screen for ease of use on mobile. We originally designed our app with a top and bottom nav bar, and this seemed to be excessive information for the user. </li>
                
                    <li>After reviewing our prototype, we thought it would be helpful to make an area on the navigation menu for support, where users can live chat with an agent to answer any questions.</li>
                </ul>
