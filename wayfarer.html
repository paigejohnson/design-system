                    <p>Wayfarer is a mobile application that will provide extensive information on State and National Park details and amenities for users to tailor their next park visit based on their interests and needs. It will allow users to compare park amenities such as campsites, hiking trails, and photography locations based on quality attributes like shaded areas, seclusion from other visitors, and difficulty of the activity. Additionally, users will be able to pay for park admissions, campsite reservations, and any other rentals through the system.</p>

                <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
                    <p>State and National Park systems provide too much general information with little value to individual park visitors. The Wayfarer system will allow users to streamline their park visit planning by providing comparable information that is specific to their interests. It will also make the reservation process easier.</p>
<br>
                <h3>Target Audience</h3>
                    <p>This project targets users who are looking for a way to plan outdoor activities at national and state parks. It aims to simplify the process of planning multi-day outdoor trips with detailed itineraries, as well as single-day trips for users interested in one specific feature of the park such as running/bike trails, lakes, canoe rentals, guided hikes, etc.</p>
                        
                    <p>Additionally, this project aims to provide information for those who are having trouble finding outdoor activities in their area or within the desired location. This project serves as a one-stop resource for all outdoor enthusiasts ranging from amateur to experienced to enjoy the outdoors.</p>

<br>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-12">
            <h5>User Interviews</h5>
                    <p>In our first round of research, we conducted one-on-one interviews with eight participants ranging in age from 25 to 64 and in camping/hiking experience from beginner to expert. The goal was designing a better way for discovering National Parks, camping and activities to do within the parks, and historical information regarding the parks’ landmarks. We asked participants a range of questions regarding their detailed personal experiences at outdoor parks, how they planned these adventures, and negative/positive takeaways from these trips.</p>
<br>
<!--              <h5>Interview Insights</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Safety concerns were mentioned by most users. Due to pandemic restrictions, there are social distancing and health risk concerns. As well as long-standing safety concerns over visibility at night, camping solo, dangerous wildlife, etc.</li>
                        <li>Resources are important to most subjects. Due to cellular connection and batteries draining the users feel more comfortable navigating with a physical map because they are less likely to be without it. The subjects did use online resources to help locate nearby hikes and see images of the park as well.</li>
                        <li>Subjects who like to do day trips prefer nearby parks, whereas subjects who like to go on multi-day tips do not care about how far the park is.</li>
                        <li>Users who stated camping was their preferred activity, placed high importance on campground layout.</li>
                        <li>Across all users, most people interviewed gave preference to the planning of activities within the parks as the most important feature.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h5>User Personas</h5>
                    <p>The below user personas were created based off of results from our one-on-one interviews where participants fell into one of two groups: those who value planning their trips before going and those who value reviewing a trip afterwards to provide insight for fellow park-goers.</p>

                    <h6><u>Focus Scenario</u>: Hiker Returns Home [After]</h6>
                        <small>Elijah is a full-time student who goes camping with his 3 roommates to relieve some stress from his current semester. We chose this scenario because Elijah is looking to disconnect from technology to relieve stress during his hike. Our system is not as relevant during the experience and is more useful to him after his trip. User-provided reviews about parks, trails, and campsites will give information to future visitors to plan their hike. Below are tasks that could be carried out in this scenario:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Add pictures from hike to share with other app users</li>
                                <li>Write a review of the guided hike</li>
                                <li>Favorite landmarks that were missed during this trip for future visits</li>
                                <li>Look to see other camping or hiking places nearby</li>

                    <h6><u>Focus Scenario</u>: Camper Plans Park Trip [Before]</h6>
                        <small>Alba is a professional and a mother of a 5- and 10-year-old who wants to take their family on their first camping trip. We chose this as one of our focus scenarios because the planning process is the most important part of Alba’s experience. Because she is a busy professional and mother of two, she needs to research everything she needs to know for their trip beforehand. Once Alba and her family arrive, they do not have to waste time on finding activities to do or scrambling to find an ideal campsite. Below are tasks that could be carried out in this scenario:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Search for camping and swimming activities near me</li>
                                <li>Filter activities by kid-friendliness and peak times to visit</li>
                                <li>View descriptions of parks</li>
                                <li>Favorite landmarks, activities, and campsites at park</li>
                                <li>Compare and contrast reviews of favorites to reach a decision on your reservations</li>
                                <li>Book reservations for activities and campsite(s) on your calendar</li>
                                <li>Enable notifications for calendar events/general park notifications</li>

            <h5>Interface Metaphors</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><u>Search</u>: You can look up multiple activities happening within the park and compare campsites.</li>
                    <li><u>Reservations</u>: You can add/remove items from the shopping cart.</li>
                    <li><u>Payments</u>: The total cost of all of items that the customer owes to make a purchase. These items include campsite reservations, park admission, and other activity fees. All items are purchased with a single collective transaction.</li>
                    <li><u>Map</u>: Paper maps use labels for streets and landmarks to help readers navigate directions. Iconography is used to concisely mark common landmarks. In our system, it is important to allow users to discover new parks, hiking trails, campsites, and other outdoor landmarks in a map context. Users can determine the best way to get to a point of interest through a map visual.</li>
                    <li><u>Reviews</u>: A community bulletin is where information can be shared by the public regarding reviews on activities/campsites, advertisements, public messages, safety info, and event announcements. This information can be utilized by users for decision making and planning.</li>
                    <li><u>Support</u>: An information hotline is a 24/7 number that can be utilized by users for assistance and information. This provides users with open communication to assist with their needs.</li>
                    <li><u>Calendar</u>: A calendar is used to keep up with special dates and events. In our system, the calendar displays a user’s upcoming park reservations.</li>
                    <li><u>Notifications</u>: This includes confirming and reminding about appointments or tasks that need to be done. Our system serves as a personal assistant to the user.</li>
                </ul>
<br>
            <h5>Interaction Types</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><u>Instructing</u>: Users can instruct the app to perform tasks such as searching, filtering, refining, saving, reserving, and downloading. The user can also select multiple options within the app by clicking on landmarks, activities, campsites, calendar events, and profile features. The user can manipulate/change profile and reservation information.</li>
                    <li><u>Direct Manipulation</u>: User is directly doing a physical action while on the app.</li>
                    <li><u>Manipulation</u>: Users can zoom in and out of the map to locate specific routes or landmarks within the app.</li>
                    <li><u>Conversing</u>: Users can contact a technical support technician or park rangers via messaging. This type of system results in a conversation that is two-sided to help answer the user’s unique concerns.</li>

        <div class="col-lg-12">
            <h5>Card Sort Activity</h5>
                <p><u>Tools</u>: A web-based, open card sort was used to test users. The card-sort survey can be found at this <a href="https://t56w375i.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/ykb08zi3">here</a>.</p>
                    
                <p><u>Results</u>: Most users grouped things you would find in the park such as campsites, restrooms, hiking trails, lakes, parks, picnic areas, swimming areas, and canoe rentals. Many users grouped activities in its own group as this did not seem to fit with other categories. Many users wanted to see a location group where they placed search, compass, directions, and map. A large majority of users made a profile area with the categories such as my account, favorites, and bookmarks. They also made another main group for help and support. The last main grouping among users was that of the shopping cart, calendar, checkout, reservations, notifications, and features.</p>
<br>
            <h5>Navigation Sitemap</h5>
                <p>The following sitemap was designed based on our results from the open card sort. This is the most commonly used navigation amongst our participants.</p>

            <h5>Usability Testing</h5>
                <p>We conducted usability testing with eight users. Subjects were mainly selected based on their availability to complete the test by the date needed. Majority of users had interest and/or experience in camping/hiking</p>

                <h6><u>Focus Scenario</u>: Camper Plans Park Trip [Before]</h6>
                    <p>Imagine that you want to plan a camping trip with your family. You would like to reserve two campsites for a multiple-night stay.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Find a park that has available campsites for next weekend near you</li>
                            <li>Select a park of your choice</li>
                            <li>Add park admission to the cart, if applicable</li>
                            <li>Find two campsites that best suit your needs</li>
                            <li>Add both campsites to your cart</li>
                            <li>Pay for campsite reservation added to cart</li> 
                            <li>Add reservations to your calendar</li>
                            <li>Find existing reservation</li>
                        </ol>

                <h6><u>Focus Scenario</u>: Hiker Returns Home [After]</h6>
                    <p>Imagine you just returned home from a day hike with friends. You really enjoyed the experience and would like to leave a review and share photos of something interesting you saw on the hike.</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Find most recent park reservations visit</li>
                                <li>Add a review for a past reservation</li>
                            </ol>

            <h5>Data Analysis</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Six users found the distance from me information on the park results page useful.</li>
                    <li>One user did not find the maps useful because it did not have an indicator of their location.</li>
                    <li>Four users did not understand what “$$$ per vehicle” meant on the park page.</li>
                    <li>Four users did not know what amount was added to their cart when pressing “Add to cart”.</li>
                    <li>Three users clicked “go back” from the park page when trying to find a campsite.</li>
                    <li>All users navigated to the shopping cart via the bottom navigation icon instead of the “View Cart” button after adding an item to a cart.</li>
                    <li>Four users expected to put in their email address when checking out so they could get a receipt.</li>
                    <li>Six users found their upcoming reservation quickly.</li>
                    <li>Six users easily found the area to write a review.</li>
                    <li>Six users liked the division of “upcoming reservations” and “past reservations”.</li>
                    <li>Six users successfully completed the first task scenario.</li>
                    <li>Six users successfully completed the second task scenario.</li>
                    <li>Seven users said they would recommend the application to someone else.</li>
                    <li>Three users said that they would want a calendar that is updated to the current day.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>We conducted extensive user research within this project before performing any prototyping. It would have been helpful to create more than one iteration to improve upon, such as a low-fidelity prototype or sketch, instead of jumping straight to the final design concept.</li>

                    <li>We used an open card sort for surveying users, but we may have benefited more from a closed card sort because there was a large variety in the categories they chose to group together, making it difficult for our team to decipher what groupings worked best.</li>                                      
                    <li>The usability testing for our mobile prototype was performed on laptop and desktop screens, which reduced the validity of the evaluation and made it more difficult for users to scroll to see all information on each page.</li>

                    <li>For usability tests conducted via Zoom, asking users to share their screen made the evaluations less natural for them.</li>

                    <li>The feedback from testing may have been skewed in a more positive direction due to our pre-existing relationships with our evaluation participants, whereas lesser known participants could have provided more honest and useful feedback.</li>

                    <li>Users seemed to get distracted away from the task at hand at times either by going off track of the questions and speaking about extraneous details or from others in their environment interrupting the meeting.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>One finding from our usability testing that users would have liked to see is adding more locations to the search bar such as city, state, and park as opposed to just searching by zip code.</li>

                    <li>Another design revision needed is to create more realistic data that is consistent and free of typos across the prototype, especially for reservation dates, descriptions of parks/activities, search results maps, individual park maps, as well as a “You are Here” indicator on maps.</li>

                    <li>We then took into consideration supporting multiple languages (ex. English, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic, etc.) to make the application more accessible to various types of users.</li>

                    <li>Users expressed interest in a separate payment experience for guests and signed-in members. Guests will need to provide their email address/phone number and signed-in members will already have this information stored in their profile. Also, including a nudge for guests to sign up for an account during the checkout process will increase user engagement.</li>

                    <li>Next, adding the ability for users to review purchases/totals before submitting payment information, as well as the option to undo removing something from the Shopping Cart or Favorites will ensure error prevention.</li>

                    <li>An important piece needed in the next steps is a social component within the app under My Profile so users can connect with other campers/hikers before, during, and after their trips.</li>
                </ul>
